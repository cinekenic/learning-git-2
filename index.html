      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <h2>by Adele</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, it's me I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to
        meet To go over everything They say that time's supposed to heal ya But
        I ain't done much healing
      </p>

      <p>
        Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to
        be When we were younger and free I've forgotten how it felt before the
        world fell at our feet
      </p>

      <p>There's such a difference between us And a million miles</p>

      <p>
        Hello from the other side I must've called a thousand times To tell you
        I'm sorry for everything that I've done But when I call, you never seem
        to be home
      </p>

      <p>
        Hello from the outside At least I can say that I've tried To tell you
        I'm sorry for breaking your heart But it don't matter, it clearly
        doesn't tear you apart anymore
      </p>

      <p>
        Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm
        sorry I hope that you're well Did you ever make it out of that town
        where nothing ever happened?
      </p>

      <p>It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time</p>

      <p>
        So hello from the other side (Other side) I must've called a thousand
        times (Thousand times) To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've
        done But when I call, you never seem to be home
      </p>

      <p>
